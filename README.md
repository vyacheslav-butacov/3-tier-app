## 1. Infrastructure Platform Selection

**Chosen Platform:** **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**

**Arguments:**

- **Comprehensive Services:** AWS offers a wide range of services that cater to all the requirements, including compute, storage, databases, networking, and security.
- **Scalability:** AWS services like EC2, ECS, and EKS provide robust autoscaling capabilities.
- **High Availability:** AWS's global infrastructure ensures fault tolerance and high availability through multiple Availability Zones (AZs) and Regions.
- **Security:** AWS provides extensive security features, including IAM, VPC, Security Groups, and encryption services.
- **Automation Support:** Tools like AWS CloudFormation and Terraform facilitate infrastructure as code (IaC) for automated deployments.



## 2. Orchestration Technology and Components

**Chosen Orchestration Technology:** **Kubernetes (EKS on AWS)**

**Components:**

- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):** Managed Kubernetes service to orchestrate containerized microservices.
- **Helm:** Package manager for Kubernetes to manage complex applications.
- **Ingress Controller (NGINX):** Manages external access to services within the cluster.
- **Cert-Manager:** Automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates.
- **Prometheus & Grafana:** For monitoring and visualization.
- **Kube-Proxy and CNI (e.g., Calico):** For networking within the cluster.

**Arguments:**

- **Scalability:** Kubernetes inherently supports scaling of applications based on demand.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Kubernetes ensures that applications are running as desired, automatically replacing failed containers.
- **Extensibility:** A rich ecosystem of tools and plugins enhances Kubernetes capabilities.
- **Community Support:** Strong community support ensures continuous improvements and best practices.
